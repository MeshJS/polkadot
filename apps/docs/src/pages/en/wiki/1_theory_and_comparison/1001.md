## Building on Polkadot: Solutions and Comparisons

Polkadot’s multi-chain architecture offers unique opportunities for developers. Below, we break down the types of solutions you can build, tailored for Cardano developers transitioning to Polkadot.

#### **1. DApp Hosted on a Parachain**

**What it is**:  
Deploy decentralized applications (DApps) on a _parachain_—a specialized blockchain integrated into Polkadot’s ecosystem. Parachains inherit security from Polkadot’s Relay Chain and can communicate with other parachains via Polkadot’s Cross-Chain Messaging Protocol (XCMP).

**Key Features**:

- **Shared Security**: No need to bootstrap your own validator network—security is provided by Polkadot’s Relay Chain.
- **Interoperability**: Seamlessly interact with other parachains (e.g., swapping tokens, sharing data).
- **Scalability**: Dedicated block space ensures your DApp avoids congestion from other chains.

**Use Cases**:

- Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) requiring cross-chain liquidity.
- Gaming platforms needing fast, low-cost transactions.
- Identity systems leveraging data from multiple chains.
- Pretty much everything that a DApp can do on Cardano

**Similarity to Cardano development experience**:  
If you’re used to building on Cardano’s layer-1, parachains offer similar ease of deployment but with built-in cross-chain capabilities.

#### **2. Parachain Continuously Connected to the Relay Chain**

**What it is**:  
A parachain that maintains an _active, permanent connection_ to Polkadot’s Relay Chain. It participates in Polkadot’s consensus and benefits from continuous shared security.

**Key Features**:

- **Real-Time Security**: Validators from the Relay Chain finalize your blocks.
- **XCMP Access**: Send/receive messages to other parachains instantly.
- **Governance Integration**: Participate in Polkadot’s decentralized governance.

**Use Cases**:

- High-frequency DeFi protocols.
- Social networks requiring real-time data sharing.

**Similarity to Cardano development experience**:  
Think of this as a “layer-1.5” chain—more autonomy than Cardano’s mainnet but with stronger security guarantees than isolated networks. Cardano offers a similar solution with the new partner chains project <https://github.com/input-output-hk/partner-chains> where there is no relay chain but the security is offered by the SPO (Stake Pool Operator) that voluntarily participates in the project.

#### **3. Parachain Intermittently Connected (On-Demand)**

**What it is**:  
A parachain that connects to the Relay Chain _only when needed_, using Polkadot’s **parathread** model. Pay for block validation as you go (like a “pay-as-you-go” parachain).

**Key Features**:

- **Cost Efficiency**: Avoid leasing a full parachain slot—ideal for low-throughput apps.
- **Flexible Connectivity**: Spin up connectivity during peak demand (e.g., NFT drops).
- **Same Security**: Inherit Relay Chain security when connected.

**Use Cases**:

- Event-driven applications (e.g., ticketing systems).
- Seasonal DApps (e.g., holiday-themed platforms).

**Similarity to Cardano development experience**:  
Similar to “hydra” <https://hydra.family/> (a layer 2 scaling solution focused on high-throughput off-chain transactions), parathreads offer a modular scaling solution—but instead of state channels, they prioritize flexible, cost-aware connectivity to Polkadot’s shared security layer.

#### **4.** **Independent Chain with a Secured Bridge**

**What it is**:  
Build your own standalone blockchain and connect it to Polkadot via a **trustless bridge**. This allows your chain to interact with Polkadot’s ecosystem (e.g., parachains, DApps) without needing to become a parachain.

**Key Features**:

- **Sovereignty**: Full control over your chain’s consensus, tokenomics, and upgrades.
- **Bridge Security**: Use cryptographic protocols (like zk-SNARKs or optimistic verification) to enable trustless transfers of assets/data between chains.
- **Cross-Ecosystem Reach**: Connect not just to Polkadot, but also to other networks like Ethereum, Cosmos, or Cardano.

**Use Cases**:

- Enterprise chains needing to interoperate with public networks.
- Existing projects (e.g., on Cardano) expanding to Polkadot without migrating entirely.

**Similarity to Cardano development experience:**  
Cardano doesn’t provide tools to build your own blockchain, but you could build a partner chain (which is Substrate-based) secured by Cardano’s SPO, but with no bridging to Cardano feature. However independent chains (like _Milkomeda_) can connect to Cardano’s mainnet via bridges.

#### **5. Solo Chain Without Shared Security**

**What it is**:  
A fully independent blockchain (built with Substrate) that does _not_ connect to Polkadot’s Relay Chain. You’re responsible for your own security and consensus (e.g., PoA, PoS).

**Key Features**:

- **Total Autonomy**: No reliance on Polkadot’s governance or upgrades.
- **Custom Consensus**: Experiment with novel mechanisms (e.g., DAG-based, PoET).
- **Trade-Offs**: No interoperability or shared security.

**Use Cases**:

- Private enterprise networks.
- Research chains testing experimental features.

**Similarity to Cardano development experience**:  
None

### **Choosing your Polkadot path**

| **Solution** | **Best For** | **Security** | **Interoperability** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DApp on Parachain | Cross-chain apps | High (Relay Chain) | Full |
| Independent Chain + Bridge | Bridging ecosystems | Custom | Partial (via bridge) |
| Continuous Parachain | High-frequency apps | High | Full |
| On-Demand Parachain | Cost-sensitive, intermittent use cases | High (when connected) | Partial |
| Solo Chain | Experiments/private networks | Self-managed | None |

Polkadot’s flexibility lets you tailor your solution to your project’s needs—whether you prioritize security, cost, or sovereignty. For Cardano developers, this opens doors to cross-chain innovation while leveraging familiar concepts like smart contracts and decentralized governance.
