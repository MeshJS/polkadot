## Building a Smart Contract using Ink! (Rust) and Astar  

_What is [Ink!](https://www.parity.io/blog/what-is-paritys-ink) ?_

It's a domain-specific language (DSL) embedded within [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), designed specifically for writing [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) (Wasm) smart contracts on Polkadot.
By using Rust, developers benefit from its strong memory safety, advanced type system, and comprehensive development tools. Rust’s ownership model ensures that typical issues like null pointer dereferencing and buffer overflows are things of the past.
Wasm offers fast execution speeds, platform independence, and enhanced security through sandboxed environments.

_Why [Astar](https://astar.network/) Parachain?_

Polkadot’s Relay Chain is designed for security and interoperability, not smart contract execution. To build a smart contract, you need a **parachain** like Astar, which supports the “contracts” pallet. For Cardano developers: this is like building on Cardano’s mainnet, but instead of deploying directly to the base layer, you deploy to a specialized chain (Astar) that handles smart contracts _and_ connects to Polkadot’s shared security. You could spin your parachain and deploy your smart contracts on it, but we are following an easy path for educational purposes.

### **Step 1: Setup the environment**

#### **1.1 Install dependencies**

```sh
# Install Rust & Cargo (if not already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf <https://sh.rustup.rs> | sh

# Add WASM compilation target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Install ink! CLI
cargo install --force --locked cargo-contract
```

For this tutorial we used `cargo` and `rustc` 1.84.1

#### **1.2 Create a new ink! project** my_first_contract

```sh
cargo contract new my_first_contract

cd my_first_contract
```

### **Step 2: Write a simple smart contract (an incrementor)**

#### **2.1 Open lib.rs and replace it with this code**

```sh
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std, no_main)]

#[ink::contract]
mod my_first_contract {
    #[ink(storage)]
    pub struct MyContract {
        value: i32,
    }

    impl MyContract {
        #[ink(constructor)]
        pub fn new(init_value: i32) -> Self {
            Self { value: init_value }
        }

        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn get(&self) -> i32 {
            self.value
        }

        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn increment(&mut self) {
            // Use checked_add to prevent overflow
            self.value = self.value
                .checked_add(1)
                .expect("Overflow in increment operation");
        }
    }
}
```

#### **2.2 Explanation**

- **#\[ink(storage)\]**: Defines the contract’s state (like a Cardano datum).
- **#\[ink(message)\]**: Public functions callable by users (similar to Cardano’s endpoints).
- **#\[ink(constructor)\]**: Initializes the contract (like a Plutus validator script).

### **Step 3: Compile the Contract**

```sh
cargo contract build
```

This generates:

- my_first_contract.wasm (compiled contract).
- metadata.json (ABI for frontend interaction).

### **Step 4: Get SBY tokens (Shibuya Testnet)**

1. **Connect to Shibuya Testnet**:
    - Visit [Astar Portal (Shibuya Testnet)](https://portal.astar.network/shibuya-testnet/assets)
    - Click "Connect Wallet" (use [Talisman](https://talisman.xyz/) wallet for simplicity)
2. **Use the Faucet**:
    - Scroll to the **SBY Token** section
    - Click "Faucet" and request SBY free tokens
    - **Note**: SBY is the testnet token for Shibuya

### **Step 5 (option A - easy): Deploy with UseInk playground**

#### **4.1 Connect to Astar via UseInk**

1. Go to <https://ui.use.ink/> →select **Astar Shibuya**
2. Select **Add new contract**

#### **4.2 Upload the Contract**

1. Click **Upload new contract code**.
2. Set the name (e.g. my_first_contract)
3. Upload Contract Bundle (which is my_first_contract.contract)
4. Next and sign

#### **4.3 Call the Contract**

1. **Call get**: Retrieve the current value.
2. **Call increment**: Update the value (requires a small gas fee).

### **Step 5 (option B - facing PolkadotJS): Deploy directly to the parachain**

#### **4.1 Connect to Astar’s Testnet (Shibuya)**

1. Go to [Polkadot-JS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/) → **Shibuya Testnet**.
2. Navigate to **Developer → Contracts**.

#### **4.2 Upload the Contract**

1. Click **Upload & deploy code**.
2. Upload my_first_contract.wasm and metadata.json.
3. Set the **initial value** (e.g., 42) during deployment.

#### **4.3 Call the Contract**

1. **Call get**: Retrieve the current value.
2. **Call increment**: Update the value (requires a small gas fee).
