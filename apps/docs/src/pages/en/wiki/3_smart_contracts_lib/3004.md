## Building an Escrow Contract (in Ink!)

Escrow is a financial arrangement where a neutral third party holds funds/assets temporarily while two parties complete a transaction. It ensures:  

1. **Security**: Funds are protected until conditions are met.  
2. **Trust**: Neither party can act unilaterally.  
3. **Automation**: Rules are enforced programmatically (via smart contracts).
