## Building a dApp with Ink!

There are a few tutorials on building a web frontend for on Ink!, but probably the most relevant is [use-Ink Examples](https://github.com/use-ink/ink-examples). Updated resources are on [use.ink](https://use.ink/frontend/overview/).

### 1. Supercharge the incrementor

We will enhance our first smart contract by adding **custom increments**, **reset functionality**, **unit tests** and a basic frontend.

Follow the instructions of the [previous chapter](./2001.md) to create a new contract, but this time call it "incrementor". When compilation is completed **Replace `lib.rs`** with this upgraded code:  

```sh
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std, no_main)]

#[ink::contract]
mod incrementor {
    #[ink(storage)]
    pub struct Incrementor {
        count: u32,
    }

    #[ink(event)]
    pub struct Incremented {
        new_count: u32,
    }

    #[ink(event)]
    pub struct Reset {
        reset_to: u32,
    }

    impl Incrementor {
        #[ink(constructor)]
        pub fn new(init_value: u32) -> Self {
            Self { count: init_value }
        }

        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn increment(&mut self, by: u32) {
            self.count = self.count.checked_add(by).expect("Overflow in increment operation");
        
        }

        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn get_count(&self) -> u32 {
            self.count
        }

        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn reset(&mut self) {
            self.count = 0;
            self.env().emit_event(Reset { reset_to: 0 });
        }
    }

    #[cfg(test)]
    mod tests {
        use super::*;

        #[ink::test]
        fn new_works() {
            let contract = Incrementor::new(0);
            assert_eq!(contract.get_count(), 0);
        }

        #[ink::test]
        fn increment_works() {
            let mut contract = Incrementor::new(1);
            contract.increment(1);
            assert_eq!(contract.get_count(), 2);
            contract.increment(2);
            assert_eq!(contract.get_count(), 4);
        }

        #[ink::test]
        fn reset_works() {
            let mut contract = Incrementor::new(5);
            contract.reset();
            assert_eq!(contract.get_count(), 0);
        }
    }
}
```
As you can see, we can increment it by a specific amount and reset and test it.

### 2. Time to run the tests

*Polkadot developers test in Rust, not HSpec â€“ but the principles are familiar.*  
```sh
#same cargo workflow you already know
cargo test
```

Now deploy and instantiate it as learned, and test it with the playground. If successful, it's time for frontend. Let's build the web scaffold.

### 3. Frontend: From Rust to React

```sh
npx create-react-app incrementor
cd incrementor
npm install @polkadot/api @polkadot/api-contract
# npm install web-vitals if you have dependencies
```

Connect to Your Contract:  

1. Copy `target/incrementor.json` to `src/` (this is your ABI)
2. Open your `src/App.js` and paste the content of [App.js](./App.js)
3. Substitute `YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` with the address of the deployed contract.

Everything should be ready now starting the web server  

### 4. Launch Your dApp and play

```sh
npm start
```

**Visit `localhost:3000`**
