## Chapter 3 - The main divergence: Account-Based vs. eUTXO

### **1\. The Account-Based Model Polkadot (same as Ethereum)**

**How It Works**:

- Think of a **centralized bank ledger** where everyone shares the same record.
- Every account’s balance is stored in a **global database** visible to the network.
- Transactions update balances directly in this shared ledger.

```sh
Global Ledger:
- Alice: 100 DOT
- Bob: 50 DOT

Transaction: Alice sends 20 DOT to Bob
→ Global Ledger updates to:
 - Alice: 80 DOT
 - Bob: 70 DOT
```

**Key Features**:

- **Centralized/Global State**: Like a bank, everyone trusts the same ledger.
- **Mutable Balances**: Balances are overwritten (no record of transaction history).
- **Sequential Updates**: If Alice and Bob both send funds simultaneously, transactions queue up.

**Trade-Offs**:

- ✅ **Simplicity**: Easy to track balances (just check the ledger).
- ❌ **Bottlenecks**: High demand for popular accounts (e.g., a DEX pool) slows the network.

### **2\. The eUTXO Model Cardano (inspired by Bitcoin)**

**How It Works**:

- Think of **physical cash in your wallet**. You own specific “notes” (UTXOs), and spending them requires breaking them into smaller denominations.
- Each UTXO is like a unique bill with a value and ownership tag.
- **Transactions consume UTXOs** and create new ones, like handing over cash and receiving change.

```sh
Alice’s Wallet:
 - UTXO 1: 50 ADA (Wallet A)
 - UTXO 2: 50 ADA (Wallet B)

Transaction: Alice sends 70 ADA to Bob
→ Consumes UTXO 1 (50 ADA) + UTXO 2 (50 ADA)
→ Creates:
 - New UTXO for Bob: 70 ADA (Wallet C) 
 - New UTXO for Alice (change): 30 ADA (Wallet A or D)
```

**Key Features**:

- **Decentralized Ownership**: UTXOs are like cash in your wallet—no global ledger tracks them.
- **Immutable History**: UTXOs are spent, not modified, creating an auditable trail.
- **Parallel Processing**: Different wallets (UTXOs) can transact simultaneously.

**Trade-Offs**:

- ✅ **Scalability**: No waiting in line—transactions using separate UTXOs run in parallel.
- ❌ **Complexity**: Developers must manually track and combine UTXOs (like managing cash).

### **Key Differences Simplified**

| **Aspect** | **Account Model (Polkadot)** | **eUTXO Model (Cardano)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **State Management** | Single global ledger (like a bank). | UTXOs are owned locally (like cash). |
| **Transaction Flow** | Sequential updates (wait your turn). | Parallel processing (no waiting). |
| **Security** | Risk of reentrancy (shared state). | No reentrancy (deterministic validation). |
| **Flexibility** | Easy to code, hard to scale. | Hard to code, easy to scale. |

### **Why This Matters for Developers**

- **Account Model**:
  - _Best for_: Apps needing shared state (e.g., a lending protocol where users interact with a central pool).
  - _Watch out for_: Race conditions (e.g., two users trying to borrow the last token).
- **eUTXO Model**:
  - _Best for_: High-throughput apps (e.g., NFT mints, batch payments) or atomic swaps.
  - _Watch out for_: “UTXO management hell” (e.g., splitting/merging UTXOs for complex logic).

### **Final Analogy**

- **Polkadot’s Account Model**:
  - Like a **shared Excel sheet**—everyone edits the same file, but you wait your turn to avoid errors.
- **Cardano’s eUTXO Model**:
  - Like **passing physical cash**—no central ledger, but you need to organize your wallet(s) carefully.
